### Hi~

I'm the cute persona of one gamehacker and `JP` âž§ `EN` translator in the visual novel scene.  
Apart from that whole "writing" thing, I mostly spend my time inside **IDA**, **x64dbg** and **Visual Studio**, doing **C++**.  

I head the [@pantsudev](https://github.com/pantsudev) VN TL team.  
You can read all about our current work [here](https://pantsudev.carrd.co/).

I'm available for freelance work on anything that's within my skillset.  
Feel free to message me on Twitter, or **preferably Discord** to discuss whatever.
